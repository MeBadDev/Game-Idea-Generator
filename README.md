# GAME IDEA GENERATOR
## What idea can it give me?
something like this:
```
A sport game where time stops when (something) happen on a planet
A fps game where you have a grapple gun in a city
A RPG game where you can blow up everything in a castle
A platform-shooter game where you throw potions at enemys in a city
A shooter game where your health become lower and lower until you reach the goal in the ocean
```

## Why another game idea generator?
I feel like others are giving us bad idea and not really customizable
## How does this fix it?
you can fully customize everything. from the code of entire generator, to settings, what could it generate...
## How do i use it?
download the entire respository
Run main.py (you need to install python first)
## Where can i change settings?
There are only a few settings(right now). you can find them in config.json
## What if i want to add my own rules/want to remove a rule?
just change `rules/place.txt`, `rules.txt` or `rules/types.txt`

If you feel we should modify some rules, feel free to open a issue/pull request!
## Why did it give me blank rules?
Remove every blank lines in `rules/place.txt`, `rules.txt` and` rules/types.txt`

Remember to check the end of those file!
## What does those settings mean?
`filepaths`: paths to the file containing all of your rules

`generate_count`: how much game idea should it generate once

## Why does its code looks like trash?
because it is! i am a completely noob at python. can somebody open a PR or something?
## I have some question!
You can contact me by opening an issue or MSG me on discord
