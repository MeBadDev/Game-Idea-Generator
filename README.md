# GAME IDEA GENERATOR
## Why another game idea generator?
I feel like others are giving us bad idea and not really customizable
## How do i generate?
Run main.py (you need to install python first!)
## Where can i change settings?
There are only a few settings(right now). you can find them in config.json
## What if i want to add my own rules/want to remove a rule?
just change place.txt, rules.txt or types.txt
